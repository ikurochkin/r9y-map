# High Water Mark Prediction

**High Water Mark Prediction:**

* The ability to reasonably accurately predict the high water mark capacity for a system, i.e. the capacity beyond which it will stop or seriously degrade functioning. This originates from the physical concept of high water mark prediction, which involves forecasting the highest water level that will occur during a specific time period, typically a tidal cycle or storm event.

**How high water marks are used:**

* High water marks are used in system performance monitoring to track the peak usage or demand of a particular resource over a given period. This information can be invaluable for capacity planning, troubleshooting performance bottlenecks, and optimizing resource allocation.

* Identifying Peak Usage: High water marks record the highest value reached by a specific metric, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, network bandwidth, or disk I/O. By tracking these peaks, administrators can identify the maximum resource demands placed on the system.

* Capacity Planning: High water marks provide insights into how close the system is operating to its limits. This information can help determine whether the system has sufficient capacity to handle future growth or if additional resources are needed.

* Troubleshooting Performance Bottlenecks: By comparing high water marks of different resources, administrators can pinpoint which components are causing performance bottlenecks. For example, if the high water mark for CPU utilization is consistently high while other resources have ample capacity, it suggests that the CPU is the limiting factor.

* Optimizing Resource Allocation: High water marks can help identify underutilized resources. If a resource's high water mark is significantly lower than its maximum capacity, it indicates that the resource is not being fully utilized and could potentially be allocated elsewhere.

* Setting Thresholds: High water marks can be used to establish thresholds for alerts or automated actions. For example, if the high water mark for memory usage exceeds a certain threshold, an alert can be triggered to notify administrators, or an automated action can be taken to free up memory.

**Examples of High Water Mark Usage:**

* Database Systems: High water marks can track the maximum number of concurrent connections, the highest amount of memory used, or the peak transaction throughput.
* Web Servers: High water marks can monitor the maximum number of simultaneous requests, the highest CPU utilization, or the peak network traffic.
* Virtual Machines: High water marks can track the maximum CPU, memory, and disk usage of virtual machines, helping identify resource contention and optimize resource allocation.
